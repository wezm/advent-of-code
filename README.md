# My Advent of Code Solutions

My approach to these is:

- Don't look at any other solutions until I've done my own.
- Don't update solutions after looking at other solutions.
- Whilst not an absolute rule, most solutions stick to the standard library of the implementation language.

From 2019 on I'm usually optimising for time to completion over code quality in order to limit the amount of time participating in AoC takes.
