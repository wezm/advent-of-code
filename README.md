# My advent of code solutions

My approach to these is:

- Don't look at any other solutions until I've done my own
- Don't update solution after looking at other solutions
- Whilst not an explicit goal most if not all solutions just use Rust and the standard library

In 2019 I'm optimising for time to completion over code quality in order to limit the amount of time partipating in AoC takes.
