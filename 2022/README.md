# Advent of Code 2022

This year I decided to forego my usual Rust solutions and try to solve the
problems in [Gleam]. Gleam is a statically typed functional programming
language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine, or JavaScript engine
implemented in Rust. My code targets the Erlang VM.

The Gleam code was written against version 0.25 of the language.

## Run

```sh
gleam run run n  # Run AoC day n
```
